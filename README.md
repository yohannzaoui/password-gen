### 📥 Installation & Setup

1. **Download the files**: Save the `index.html`, `style.css`, and `script.js` files into the same folder.
2. **No Server Required**: Since this is a client-side application, you don't need a local server.
3. **Run**: Simply double-click `index.html` to open it in your preferred web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, or Safari).

> [!TIP]
> This application uses a CDN to load **Bootstrap** and **QR Code** libraries. Ensure you have an active internet connection for the icons and QR generation to work correctly.
